# Proto-langspil hardware build tips and hints

The laser cut plywood parts of the proto-langspil come together by gluing (any fast setting wood glue is fine) or fastening with mechanical (M4) screws to nuts (often embedded in the structure to receive them).

Start by cutting all the parts in 6 or 3mm as appropriate, we used birch laser ply.

None of the glued parts need excessive clamping force but when assembling the largest four pieces, making up the soundbox and body of the instrument, it is good to have clamps at hand to help the pieces set square. Note that the screw slots to either end on the side pieces are differently sized, as seen here:

You want the longer slots (here to the right) to correspond to the overhanging ends of the top and bottom pieces. Apply glue thinly on every surface where the parts touch.

When the glue is setting it can help to clamp the assembly lightly to a tabletop with 2-3 clamps. This should help the assembly square off and set the fingers well into their respective slots. Wipe away excess glue with a damp rag in this and subsequent steps.

Assembling the combination end-cap and upper nut:

Again apply glue thinly everywhere the parts touch and press them together. A spring clamp or two can be comfortable for holding the parts in place while they set (holding them firmly togethere and checking alignment for 5 minutes while the glue gets tacky will achieve the same result). Make sure that when looking at the part from the top, the string holes are oriented to the left:

The tuning machine bracket has glued parts which are then fastened together with screws:

The spacers on the underside of the plate can, but don’t have to be, glued to it. the individual tuning machine holders are 3 layers of glued parts each:

Finger pressure is quite enough to keep the parts in place while glue sets. Continually check that alignment is good while the glue is tacking up. The finished part looks like this:

Install the tuning machines before you do the final assembly, make sure to use the little wood screw provided with the tuning machines to keep them from rotating once strings are tightened. The M4 nuts drop into slots in relation to every bolt needed to fasten the parts together. A drop of hot-glue (or Blu Tack in a pinch) to keep the nuts in place will make the assembly less fiddly. 

The assembled terminuses can now be bolted onto the main body:

The cups holding the pickups are adjustable in hight (helps for fine adjustment once you start to use the instrument) and bolt together onto a larger bracket straddling the soundbox.

Glue the following together:

Making sure everything is oriented to the left (view from top):

<img width="659" alt="Screenshot_2022-01-28_at_18 24 06" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2885827/151868625-850d4c63-bd43-4a62-b5fd-3a5e78b50a44.png">

Hotglue is great for setting the pickups in the cups (use sparingly and then it is easy to remove if the pickups get repurposed for something else later). Set the pickups about 2mm proud of the top of the cups.

The next part is the fingerboard, its glued:

<img width="736" alt="Screenshot_2022-01-28_at_19 02 09" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2885827/151868664-9183ace4-e985-4c20-9c68-421489a92f77.png">

But then needs to be shaped a little. Looking from the front (”feet” pointing towards you) we want to remove about 1.5-2mm from the right foot (about a third of the thickness of the bottom piece). This is to allow for cleaner fretting once your frets are installed, If you have a belt sander it is great to try to create a continuous surface on the two feet like by bringing the whole fretboard down onto it as illustrated below:

<img width="965" alt="Screenshot_2022-01-28_at_19 03 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2885827/151868675-898f362d-9425-47ce-b49c-dc9dc683b184.png">

If you don’t have access to a belt sander you can lay down some sandpaper and put in the work manually. Alternatively you can just pry one or two layers off the plywood with a sharp knife. The quality of the mod is not super crucial as eventually fastening the fingerboard in place with the screw and nut will stabilise it in relation to the rest of the instrument.

The last bit of assembly is the electronics tray in 3mm plywood:

<img width="478" alt="Screenshot_2022-01-28_at_18 55 52" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2885827/151868716-080e1d56-c510-405b-a5d1-15b1984352ae.png">

You can now assemble everything:

<img width="785" alt="Screenshot_2022-01-28_at_19 12 25" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2885827/151868736-53c92c2c-3a50-43ad-82d2-6a40e2d62afc.png">

Our frets are 3D printed in water washable UV resin:

They slide onto the fingerboard where they can be semi-permanently fixed in place for your desired scale (with a drop of hotglue for example) or they can be kept free. The geometry has a hole intended for an M2 set screw to temporarily fix frets in place.

The set screw hole is just shy of 2mm in size (1.85) and a thread can be forced by inserting a screw directly into the material. Depending your resin it may be too brittle and break, in this case you may try forcing the thread before UV curing your part. Or simply tapping the thread in a fully cured part with an M2 tap.
